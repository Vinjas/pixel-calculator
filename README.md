## Introduction
*Pixel Retro Calculator* is a simple web application, created with React.

The calculator uses **Formula/Expression Logic** for it's calculations.

It is a simple calculator with a retro pixel style. It supports many operations:
* Add
* Substract
* Multiply
* Divide
* Decimals

## Technologies
*Pixel Retro Calculator* is based on React Framework, using a single component as the whole calculator, changing the component states through input values and Math's Expression Logic.

Every Input is collected into an *input array* which is displayed at the top of the calculator screen.

Then, every time the equal key, or any operator key is pressed, the input is calculated as a string and processed into it's numeral result, performing all the operations following a Formula Logic.

## Launching the APP
The application has been publicly deployed on surge.sh.

* Better css grid based organization.
* Add % feature.
